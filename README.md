King's Gambit
=============

King's Gambit is a 3D printable chess set inspired by the classic Staunton design, written in OpenSCAD.

In an [announcement post](http://iamwil.posterous.com/designing-kings-gambit-and-using-openscad) on my blog, I give some details and some pictures about King's Gambit. 

Print it out
------------

In order to print out the chess set, you'll need a 3D printer, like the [Ultimaker](http://blog.ultimaker.com/), [Makerbot](http://makerbot.com), or [Prusa Mendel](http://www.makergear.com/products/3d-printers).

To print it out, you need to "compile" the *.scad files into *.stl files. You can use [OpenSCAD](http://openscad.org) to compile and render using CGAL (push F6). Then, you'll be able to export the model as an STL file. Save it to the "print" directory.

Then load the STL files into using the software that your printer uses to print out objects.
